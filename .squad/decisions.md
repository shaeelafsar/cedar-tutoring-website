## Active Decisions

### 2026-05-03T15:51:16.373-05:00: Reviews grade-level filtering derived from testimonial relation text
**By:** Trinity (Frontend Engineer)
**Status:** APPROVED
**Decision:** The Reviews page derives its grade-level filter (`elementary`, `middle-school`, `high-school`, `all-ages`) from each testimonial's existing `relation` text instead of adding a new dedicated `gradeLevel` field to `content/collections/testimonials.json`.
**Why:**
- Avoids duplicating information already present in the testimonial content model
- Keeps the testimonial schema lean while still supporting meaningful filters on the all-reviews page
- Preserves backwards compatibility for homepage/program/test-prep testimonial consumers
**Trade-off:** If content needs more granular or editor-controlled review segmentation later, the team may still choose to add an explicit `gradeLevel` field in Phase 2.
**Impact:** All testimonials map cleanly to review filters without schema extension. Reduces JSON file size and maintenance burden.
